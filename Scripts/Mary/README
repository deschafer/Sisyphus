README Mary Scripts Folder

Right now in the scripts folder I have 4 scriptsâ€”a superclass for powerup, a temporary and permanent subclass of powerup, and a player manager proxy.

The temporary and permanent scripts are those that should be applied to a powerup sprite (I made a gold apple sprite in the sprites folder for testing).
Right now, the permanent script boosts the player's (in the proxy script) health by 10 when clicked. The temporary boosts, by 10, runs a timer, then decreases by 10. The timer is currently
not working very well, it's instantaeous.

The superclass doesn't add much yet, but will be reorgainzed later. Eventually powerups will be triggered by collisions, not clicks.
